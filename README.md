## Getting Started 💡

The tool is created for reading blending **"colors layers"** hex values above **"base layers"** <br/>All read values are written into a CSV file in the same directory as opened PSD file and with the same name
To do that just click **Write colors from layers to CSV file** in the menu

There are other utility tools as well, like:
**Set colors from CSV file**, **Transform BASE layers into pngs**, **Create folders templates**, **Set left upper pixel in COLORS**

List of **errors** during usage is written in a file in **chosen CSV directory** with **CSV's name + prefix _errors.csv**

If you want to customize the tool towards your needs look at **config.ini** in the script directory

### Toolset consist of:

- **Write colors from layers to CSV file** (Read all colors in folder COLORS. Save them into CSV file)

- **Set colors from CSV file** (Set colors from chosen CSV file into COLORS folder's layers)

- **Transform BASE layers into pngs** (Print screen all layers in folder BASE and save them into pngs)

- **Create folders templates** (Create a template in opened PSD for the tool)

- **Set left upper pixel in COLORS** (Give each COLORS's layer a pixel which is needed to be able to read color value)

- **About** (mainly usage and author's info)

### AppData are in: <em>~/.../Blending PSD colors - toolset/</em>:
- **config.ini**
  - <em>FILE STRUCTURE (How the PSD has to be constructed)
    - color_folder_name = COLORS (Name of folder from which color hex values will be gathered)
    - folders_in_it = 1 (Names of folders, created in COLORS folder)
    - layers_in_it = R,G,B (Names of each layer in folder in COLORS folder)
    - base_folder_name = BASE (Name of folder from which will be layers saved to pngs)
  - COLORS RGB (colors which will be set to layers in template)
    - R_color = FF0000 
    - G_color = 00FF00 
    - B_color = 0000FF 
  - COLOR PICKER COORDS PIXEL FILL (Color picker coordinates needed in **Set left upper pixel in COLORS**)
    - R_coord = 180,175 
    - G_coord = 140,274 
    - B_coord = 178,249</em>
